Looking at survey results of self identification of individuals, I took the ethnicity that had the largest frequency and looked at all the answers that also included this ethnicity and attempted to make subgroups of those that included this ethnicity. Then removing all of those, I looked at the next most frequently appearing race and again attempted to find subgroups of those answers left remaining. The size of the circle corresponds to the frequency in which the answers appeared. 

The circles that are white represent the answers and their frequency. I grouped some answers together that shared common phrases or races/ethnicities together into some groups. 

1. In the order of:


	Middle Eastern, American, Italian, Irish, Jewish, Portuguese, German, South Asian
	

	These were the ones that most frequently appeared. First I found the most frequent race/ethnicity, and then grouped all of them together to create one hierarchical group.

2. For each of the most frequently appearing races, I created a circle that had those who said that race alone and a group in which includes all the other races that appeared alongside it and if there was another visible frequent word within it, I made another group. 

3. Then looking at the remaining answers not including the most frequent word, I started the process over again looking at the next most frequently occurring word.
