Looking at survey results of self identification of individuals, I took the ethnicity that had the largest frequency and looked at all the answers that also included this ethnicity and attempted to make subgroups of those that included this ethnicity. Then removing all of those, I looked at the next most frequently appearing race and again attempted to find subgroups of those answers left remaining. The size of the circle corresponds to the frequency in which the answers appeared.
