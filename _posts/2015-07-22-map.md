Using the Yelp API, I generated data that incorporated address, latitudes, and longitudes to place on a zoomable map. I also found a dataset of the the most populated cities in the country to place on the map as well. With D3 I was able to create an interactive map with points in which you could zoom in and out and the points remained relative to their locations.
