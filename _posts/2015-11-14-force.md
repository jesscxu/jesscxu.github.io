Looking at survey results of self identification of individuals, I performed text mining on the data set of various responses using Python. The nodes labeled with a race/ethnicity are connected to each other according to how often the races/ethnicities appeared in one full response of self identification. The weight of the edge between the nodes correspond to how many responses included both the nodes.
