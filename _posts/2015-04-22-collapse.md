Using Seb's BigBang project which analyzes interaction within open source projects, I created an interactive force directed graph visualization using D3.js that displays the various connections of contributers, repos, and files corresponding to a GitHub organization, in this case being the Glass Bead Labs.

The organization is the center of this force directed graph, which has the contributers connected to this central point, and each of the contributors are connected to the repos and files they contributed to.

"""
For any repo, I could get a file that had which repos and files a single 
author contributed to. This allowed me to then create a JSON file that 
had source and target nodes of which things were connected to each other 
in the force directed graph.
