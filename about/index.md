Hello and welcome! I'm Jessica, a third-year undergraduate student from Dublin, Ohio, currently studying Applied Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. Over the past couple of years, I've developed an interest in working with and creating visualizations of data, specifically using [D3.js](http://d3js.org/). Please feel free to check out some of my work!
